===============

Solutions to programming quizzes posted on Reddit's /r/dailyprogrammer sub. I'll run an excercise a day or whereabouts, depending on difficulty and life's entropy at the time.

I'm doing my best to add the descriptions and input/output in .md format for everyone to look at and be able to contribute or copy for personal/offline use. Feel free to comment or suggest better solutions!
